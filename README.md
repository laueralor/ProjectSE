# Automation of Cancer Detection 🏥

## Project Overview
This software is designed to improve the speed and accuracy of cancer diagnosis using Artificial Intelligence. Our primary focus is the automated detection of breast cancer through the analysis of CT scan images.

## Technical Goals
* **Binary Classification:** The system provides a clear Positive/Negative diagnostic result.
* **High Efficiency:** Processing time is optimized to be under 2 minutes per scan.
* **Medical Standards:** The application handles images in DICOM format and integrates with PACS systems.
* **Touch-Friendly UI:** Developed for clinical environments where keyboards are not practical.

## System Architecture
The project is divided into several modules:
* **Auth Module:** Manages medical staff access.
* **Processing Module:** Handles CT upload and feature extraction.
* **AI Engine:** The core PyTorch implementation for tumor detection.
* **UI/Dashboard:** Clinical interface for results visualization.
